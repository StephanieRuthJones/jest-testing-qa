# Jest Q&A

## Initial Setup (already completed)

To set up this JS project, the author:

* Created a folder
* Ran `npm init`
* Installed Jest with `npm i --D jest`
* Added Readme with `touch README.md`
* Created `.gitignore` file with `touch .gitignore` and added `node_modules` so that node_modules would not be committed to github repo

## Project Setup (to-do)

Run `npm i` to install dependencies

## Project Steps

### Part I

1. Create `math.js` file
2. Create `add function` in `math.js` file
3. Create `subtract function` in `math.js` file
4. Create `multiply function` in `math.js` file
5. Create `divide function` in `math.js` file
6. Export all functions from file
7. Run `npm test` - What happens? Why?
