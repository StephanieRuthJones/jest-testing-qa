# Jest Q&A

## Initial Setup (already completed) - Part I

**To set up this JS project, the author:**

* Created a folder
* Ran `npm init`
* Installed Jest with `npm i --D jest`
**Question:** What does --D mean? 
* Updated `scripts` in `package.json` to 
```
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
}
```
* Added Readme with `touch README.md`
* Created `.gitignore` file with `touch .gitignore` and added `node_modules` so that node_modules would not be committed to github repo
* Create textValidation.js file with funcs 
* Create `math.js` file with `add function`, `subtract function` with error, `multiply function`, and `divide function` in `math.js` file

## Project Setup (to-do)

Run `npm i` to install dependencies

## Project Steps

### Part II
